# cer-alert-sort

## Overview

Simple Chrome extension that manipulates the Cisco Emergency Responder **ERL Information** admin web page, sorting the **Available Onsite Alert IDs** and **Onsite Alert IDs for the ERL** select boxes.

This can make individual alerts easier to find for sites with a large number of available alerts, as the select boxes are unsorted by default.
